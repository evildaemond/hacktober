## Runsheet

Located the Virtual Machine's IP;

```bash
arp-scan 192.168.146.0/24
```

Nmap Host to identify open ports on the machine and attempt to identify the host operating system;

```bash
nmap -sV -O 192.168.146.132
```

I found 2 open ports on that virtual machine; 22, and 80 using the NMAP scan, 80 led me nowhere other than learning swear words in porchagese. So I used a more verbose full scan of the machine.

```bash
nmap -p 1-65535 -T4 -A -v 192.168.146.132
```

This listed a new port; Port 1898, which, when navigated to on a web browser, shows us a drupal blog. Doing some dirb and checks for common files reveals that this is Version is 7.5.4, which is vulnrable to a CVE affectionatly called drupalgetton. This allows us to execute arbitrary code via remote code execution. Since I had no experence in Metasploit, I thought I would give it a shot.

With this, we now had a low priv shell on the www-data user account. With this we could try to do some absic enumiration on the machine to gain some infomation on how we could exploit it. Using a common linux  privlage escalation checker, I identikfied that the kernal could be susseptable to the DirtyCow exploit. I verified if the OS was x32 or x64 bit, and downloaded the uncompiled expolit for the OS using Wget and attempted to get the flag before the OS Crashed again (DirtyCow is not a stable exploit).
